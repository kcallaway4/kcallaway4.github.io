          My goal for this project was to create a wearable mechanism that moves a human hand over a piano keyboard. This allows the wearer to learn piano movements without thinking about the movements themselves. 
          
          Each finger is made up of two parts. The first part is meant to shape the wearer's hand into playing postion - a slight bend in the finger. The joint connecting the two pieces is tightened at the proper angle. The second piece attaches to the motor directly. The connector piece allows the motor fin to slip in and then it is glued in place. The motor is the driver for the finger, simply moving down when a button is pushed and back to its original postion when the button is released.

          In starting this project, I wanted to target groups of people who either have lost mobility in their hands or those who simply want to learn piano fast. Not only did this project develop my planning and fabricating skills but it has become the foundation of how I want to move forward in this field. I have discoved a new passion for creating and solving problems. I hope to continue developing this project and use it as a stepping stone to further create mechanisms that help make the things people love more accessible.

                      <p>This model was to help visualize how each finger would move naturally the wearer's finger. Originally, the finger would be driven by a chord pulled my the motor. </p>

                      <p>This is the first 3D modeled version. The issue with this was that the chord would pull the wearer's finger horizontally, rather then down. The next iterations were attempts to move the cable below the strucutre.</p>

                      <p>These models were scrapped either because they failed to print properly or they were incorrectly sized. The cable track holes were too small, they didn't fit my finger properly, and the screw holes didn't align properly.</p>

                      <p>Finger Model 7</p>
                      <p>This iteration was a new idea for how to form the wearer's hand into proper playing position. I tend to over complicate, this is an example of that. The joint adjust was unecessarily complex and 3 joints were not needed in order to move the finger properly.</p>

                      <p>Finger Model 8</p>
                      <p>This was the first iteration that I worked with velcrow straps as a method of attaching the structure to the wearer's finger. This model still included the spring attachment that proved unecessary. </p>

                      <p>Motor Attachments</p>
                      <p>From this point onward, the mechanism was connected directly to the motor in order to simplify and avoid problems down the line. In order to create the proper size connecter, I simply printed multiple pieces. Once I found the correct size, I could attach it to the next finger iteration.</p>

                      <p>Friction was not enough to hold the motor fin in place within the connector. It was a good enough fit to use glue to hold the fin in place. </p>

                      <p>This was the final iteration for the pointer finger structure. The next steps were to create the rest of the fingers in a way that would properly align with my finger joints and attach to motors of different orientations.</p>

                      <p>After contemplating the more effective way to mount the motors, I decided to build the hand plate with a thin, moldable metal. In order for this mechanism to work, the motors needed to connect to a firm structure, but for the benefit of the wearer, it also needed to mold to the natural shape of the human hand. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>The issue now was how to attach the metal plate to my hand? This iteration, I used a thick chord the wove around my hand through holes in the plate. Eventually, I switched to an elastic fabric. </p>

        <h1> Road Blocks</h1>
        </section>
        <p>
          This project, like many, had its share of roadblocks. At the beginning, it was hard to even know where to start. I began with understanding how the human hand functions. This led me to the idea of driving motion with chords. Several finger iterations were designed to have a motor pull a chord through a path under the main structure. When the motor released, a spring would move the finger back to its original position. <br>
          While experimenting with how the finger would move, I also I had to find a way to form the wearer's finger into piano playing position. The solution to this was to incorporate a joint that would tighten into the proper angle. This problem reminded me to keep it simple. I found myself creating joints that worked but were far to complicated then what was necessary. <br>
          After many misprints and sizing issues, connecting the motor directly to the finger structure seemed to be the most efficient fix. With this change, I began fabricating connector pieces that would allow for motor fins to fit snuggly and attach permanently with glue. <br>
          At this point, I had a finger structure that formed the player's finger properly, attached to the motor directly, and strapped onto the finger with velcro strips. The next problem that arose was how to connect the motors to my hand. The solution has yet to fully develop. For the purpose of this prototype and to make the deadline, I have decided to stick with a working, yet up for improvement, hand plate. This plate is made of thin, bendable metal that is strapped onto the wearer's hand with elastic. The previous model was tied with thick, chord-like, yarn and proved to be ineffiecent and easily tangle.

          <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
          <p>The completion of this project is only step one. Moving forward I plan to not only enhance the hand system itself but I plan on creating two hands capable of playing a multitude of songs without manual imput. Currently, the left hand is driven by the button system. The goal is to create a system where one can input any song and two hand systems will move across a keyboard with track systems. I want this project to turn heads. To influence how people interact with music and how we can create mechanisms that make passions more accessible. </p>
