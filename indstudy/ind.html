            Music has been a passion of mine for my whole life and has been the driving factor behind a lot of my physical computing projects. This idea was based on my love for music and desire to help those who share that love but are physically incapable. This is just the start of my journey to make music more accessible.

                      <p>Finger Model 1</p>
                      <p>Model one demonstrated a chord driven finger that, when tension was released, would snap back to its original position with a spring.
                      <br> <br>
                      The issue was the position of the track. When the chord was pulled, the finger would pull horizontally. </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='90%' data-index='1'>
                      <p>Finger Model 2</p>
                      <p>In order to allow the chord to pull vertically, I created a layered structure with the track in between two sections. This allowed for the structure to rest in a more comfortable position while also forcing a more natural movement. </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='2'>
                      <p>Finger Model 3</p>
                      <p>I have to make sure to add multiple track holes for the chord to move smoothly and to ensure a stable structure. </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='0%' data-index='3'>
                      <p>Finger Model 4</p>
                      <p>This was an attempt to connect the strucutre to the wearer's finger. The finger loop was poorly sized, unstable, and unnatural. This idea was scrapped. </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='90%' data-index='4'>
                      <p>Finger Model 5</p>
                      <p>Another attempt to attach to the wearer's hand. This was meant to be a slot to weave fabric through to make comfortably fit one's hand. It was an unsuccessful print due to printer malfunction.  </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='5'>
                      <p>Finger Model 6</p>
                      <p>This iteration brought how to position the wearer's hand back into focus. At this point, controlling all three finger joints was the plan. 
                      <br> <br>
                      I created a rotating screw slot that allowed the joint to have an adjustable angle. But I soon realized that this was an overcomplication that could be simplified.
                      </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='0%' data-index='6'>
                      <p>Finger Model 7</p>
                      <p> After simplifying, this was the model that I landed with. The screws tighten at the preferred angle while the motor pulls the cable through the system to bend the wearer's finger. 
                        <br> <br>
                      The thought process from the previous model kept me thinking of how I could simplify further... </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='90%' data-index='7'>
                      <p>Motor Attachment 1</p>
                      <p>This was when I coompletely switched up the driving force of the finger system. Rather than being controlled my a cable that was pulled by a motor, I created a connector to attach to the motor directly. After a few iterations to get the size accurate, the motor fin fit perfectly with a little hot glue to hold it in place.</p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='8'>
                      <p>Finger Model 8 <br>(Pointer Finger)</p>
                      <p>This was my first model that incorporated the direct motor attachment. This model was specifically sized for the pointer finger and would be the final design iteration. Moving forward, I began adjusting to allow for each finger to correspond with the wearer's along with the motors.  </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='0%' data-index='9'>
                      <p>Finger Model 9<br> (Middle finger)</p>
                      <p>This model is the model for the middle finger. In order to fit all five motors on the wearer's hand, I had to incorporate two stacks. The middle finger and pinky are connected to the motors on the tops of the stacks. The design needed to account for this placement. </p>
                  </div>
                  <!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
                  <div class='step' data-width='90%' data-index='9'>
                    <p>Finger Model 10<br> (Ring finger)</p>
                    <p>The ring finger proved difficult. At first I had the ring finger connected to the motor on the bottom of stack two. This ended up failing because the two fingers in the middle of a hand need more space in order to fully move without getting stuck on skin. Because of this, I had to reprint and reorient the pinky and ring finger. </p>

          <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
          <p>The completion of this project is only step one. Moving forward I plan to not only eliminate current bugs but also will create two hands capable of playing a multitude of songs without manual imput. Currently, the left hand is driven by the button system. The goal is to create a system where one can input any song and a two hand system will move across a keyboard. This will require a track system as well as music input software. </p>
