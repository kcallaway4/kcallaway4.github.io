          Music has been a passion of mine for my whole life and has been the driving factor behind a lot of my physical computing projects. This idea was based on my love for music and desire to help those who share that love but are physically incapable. This is just the start of my journey to make music more accessible.

                      <p>Finger Model 1</p>
                      <p>This model was to help visualize how each finger would move naturally the wearer's finger. Originally, the finger would be driven by a chord pulled my the motor. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='90%' data-index='1'>
                      <p>Finger Model 2</p>
                      <p>This is the first 3D modeled version. The issue with this was that the chord would pull the wearer's finger horizontally, rather then down. The next iterations were attempts to move the cable below the strucutre.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='2'>
                      <p>Models 3-6 (misprints)</p>
                      <p>These models were scrapped either because they failed to print properly or they were incorrectly sized. The cable track holes were too small, they didn't fit my finger properly, and the screw holes didn't align properly.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='3'>
                      <p>Finger Model 7</p>
                      <p>This iteration was a new idea for how to form the wearer's hand into proper playing position. I tend to over complicate, this is an example of that. The joint adjust was unecessarily complex and 3 joints were not needed in order to move the finger properly.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='4'>
                      <p>Finger Model 8</p>
                      <p>This was the first iteration that I worked with velcrow straps as a method of attaching the structure to the wearer's finger. This model still included the spring attachment that proved unecessary. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='5'>
                      <p>Motor Attachments</p>
                      <p>From this point onward, the mechanism was connected directly to the motor in order to simplify and avoid problems down the line. In order to create the proper size connecter, I simply printed multiple pieces. Once I found the correct size, I could attach it to the next finger iteration.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='6'>
                      <p>Finger Model 10</p>
                      <p>Friction was not enough to hold the motor fin in place within the connector. It was a good enough fit to use glue to hold the fin in place. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='7'>
                      <p>Hand Attachment 1</p>
                      <p>This was the final iteration for the pointer finger structure. The next steps were to create the rest of the fingers in a way that would properly align with my finger joints and attach to motors of different orientations.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='8'>
                      <p>Motor Attachment 1</p>
                      <p>After contemplating the more effective way to mount the motors, I decided to build the hand plate with a thin, moldable metal. In order for this mechanism to work, the motors needed to connect to a firm structure, but for the benefit of the wearer, it also needed to mold to the natural shape of the human hand. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>The issue now was how to attach the metal plate to my hand? This iteration, I used a thick chord the wove around my hand through holes in the plate. Eventually, I switched to an elastic fabric. </p>

                  <div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='9'>
                      <p>Finger Model 13</p>
                      <p>This was the foundation for how I would later place the other four motors on the hand. It was difficult to place the motors in an efficient, yet effective way. See journal entry _______ to see the plan for how I did so. </p>

          <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
          <p>The completion of this project is only step one. Moving forward I plan to not only enhance the hand system itself but I plan on creating two hands capable of playing a multitude of songs without manual imput. Currently, the left hand is driven by the button system. The goal is to create a system where one can input any song and two hand systems will move across a keyboard with track systems. I want this project to turn heads. To influence how people interact with music and how we can create mechanisms that make passions more accessible. </p>
