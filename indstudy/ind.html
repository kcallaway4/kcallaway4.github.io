          My goal for this project was to create a wearable mechanism that moves a human hand over a piano keyboard. This allows the wearer to learn piano movements without thinking about the movements themselves. 
          
          Each finger is made up of two parts. The first part is meant to shape the wearer's hand into playing postion - a slight bend in the finger. The joint connecting the two pieces is tightened at the proper angle. The second piece attaches to the motor directly. The connector piece allows the motor fin to slip in and then it is glued in place. The motor is the driver for the finger, simply moving down when a button is pushed and back to its original postion when the button is released.

          In starting this project, I wanted to target groups of people who either have lost mobility in their hands or those who simply want to learn piano fast. Not only did this project develop my planning and fabricating skills but it has become the foundation of how I want to move forward in this field. I have discoved a new passion for creating and solving problems. I hope to continue developing this project and use it as a stepping stone to further create mechanisms that help make the things people love more accessible.

        <h1> Road Blocks</h1>

        <p>
          This project, like many, had its share of roadblocks. At the beginning, it was hard to even know where to start. I began with understanding how the human hand functions. This led me to the idea of driving motion with chords. Several finger iterations were designed to have a motor pull a chord through a path under the main structure. When the motor released, a spring would move the finger back to its original position. <br>
          While experimenting with how the finger would move, I also I had to find a way to form the wearer's finger into piano playing position. The solution to this was to incorporate a joint that would tighten into the proper angle. This problem reminded me to keep it simple. I found myself creating joints that worked but were far to complicated then what was necessary. <br>
          After many misprints and sizing issues, connecting the motor directly to the finger structure seemed to be the most efficient fix. With this change, I began fabricating connector pieces that would allow for motor fins to fit snuggly and attach permanently with glue. <br>
          At this point, I had a finger structure that formed the player's finger properly, attached to the motor directly, and strapped onto the finger with velcro strips. The next problem that arose was how to connect the motors to my hand. The solution has yet to fully develop. For the purpose of this prototype and to make the deadline, I have decided to stick with a working, yet up for improvement, hand plate. This plate is made of thin, bendable metal that is strapped onto the wearer's hand with elastic. The previous model was tied with thick, chord-like, yarn and proved to be ineffiecent and easily tangle.
